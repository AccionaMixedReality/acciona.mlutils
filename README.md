# Acciona Magic Leap Utils

Hi there!

We are the Advanced and Digital Innovation Hub team from Acciona S.A., Spain. Here, at the Mixed Reality Skill Center, we have been working with the Magic Leap device for a while. On the process we have developed some usefull tools for Unity that we really wanted to share with the community.

## Features

* Completelly custom object persistence system builded from the ground up based on MLPersistentCoordinateFrames API. It allows saving multiple binding configurations for the same scene, in addition to more control over the binding behaviour of persistent objects
* Utility component to expose 6DOF controller input in a more familiar way for Unity developers. Also comes with some extra tools for easely treating the touchpad as a D-Pad controller.
* Unity's Input System adaptation to make the 6DOF controller behave like a mouse when interacting with world space canvas. It's full compatible with all Unity's built-in canvas input interactions. With this feature you will be able to freely create a floating menu without the need to manually code input interaction from the controller.

## Notes

Please keep in mind that we may update this utilities from time to time, but don't have any plan to do it regularly. We hope this tools can help developers to create awesome experiences with Magic Leap and Unity.
